# Trail-Tails
A web-based application that helps users find local trails using geolocation or a typed in location. The application will return ten different hiking options based off user preferences once a selection is made the app shows weather and trail conditions. The app was created using JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and jQuery technologies. Three different API calls were utilized in the creation of this application, Google Maps (for geolocation), openWeather (for current trail conditions, and lastly calls were made to the Hiking Project (for trail information such as length, name, and stars of trail). Local storage was also used in this application to save the latitude and longitude of the user, information that was used in making later API calls.
